# Tekton CLI (tkn) initializes the Kubernetes Client and at that point requires
# a valid Kubeconfig, this provides a fake one so that the tkn can initialize
# and run without erroring out when the configuration is not available
# TODO remove once https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/pull/1807 is merged and released
