The files in this directory are copied from[1] using go code generator, e.g. by
running `go generate` in this directory.

The file `doc.go` maintains a list of files that will be copied verbatim using
`../generator/borrow.sh` script. After copying the files the controller-gen tool
is run to generate the required function implementations for use in k8s API.
